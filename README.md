## [↑](#goosint-lists) Credits
Goosint is a personal project that started out in May 2023 as initially for sharing amazing, free, and ready-to-use [Open-source intelligence (OSINT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_intelligence) tools related to cybersecurity.
At the end of 2023, the plateform has expanded to provide resources related to peoples' safety in France (e.g, public services related to Internet and Security), privacy-aware tools, and more resources for cybersecurity professionnals.
In February 2025, I decided to migrate my website to github.com and make it more collaborative.

## [↑](#goosint-lists) Why “Goosint”
The name Goosint comes from the combination of the word “Go” and “OSINT” which gives GOOSINT. Simple word so you can easilly remember it :sunglasses:.
